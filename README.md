# What is HMCore?
HMCore, or **Hytale Modding Core**, is a way to reduce mod intersection and maximize compatibiliy. This is not a traditional Core Mod project. HMCore will be collection of flexible interfaces, that allow not only mods to be built upon, but also allow custom implementations.

Imagine something similar to the Flans Mod, but in addition to creating new guns and vehicles, you can also create different versions of the Flans mod itself, and customize vehicle behavior and how the guns feel like.

**This is a passion project. I don't get any benefits outside of a less fragmented modding community.**
# Why participate in HMCore?
## For Server Owners
As a server owner, you want to set youself apart from other servers. You want to be unique, to draw more users to you.
And this is actually something you can achieve with the HMCore. Often times, some of the best content originates from the community, but when you have a system already in place, you likely won't change it. HMCore is a system that allows you to give the community the opportunity to contribute while keeping your unique aspects of the server.
Because it is not a Core Mod like you know it traditionally from Minecraft, but only a collection of interfaces, you can fully customize the core version to your liking, while still maintaining full compatibiliy to the content that is built on that HMCore Module.
A unified system for ores for example ensures that there is not ten types of incompatible copper ore, or that there are no infinite material exploits created.
In a more exotic example, vehicles, you can perfect the core so that the mechanics feel spot-on, without having to open it up. There may be still public cores out, but your core will feel unique, and give the server its very special flair. And still you can use public content that was created for it.
### The core reasons join HMCore as a Server Owner
* HMCore is **social**. Your community can contribute without you having to open the source code.
* HMCore is **unique**. Custom core implentations leave room for rich customization and optimization.
* HMCore is **private**. Your implementation is yours.
* HMCore is **riskless**. Interfaces are licensed under the MIT license.
* HMCore is **democratic**. Your voice counts.
## For Private Modders
### If you are a traditional modder
If you are like most modders out there, you are building mods out of passion, and because you enjoy using them youself. HMCore is a way to ensure that your mod won't paritially intersect with other mods, and minimizes the work 
### If you create mod packs
HMCore is not a traditional Core mod. HMCore is a collection of interfaces, open to both sides. Most of the core mods are built with skins in mind, and feature customizable names and more. This means that you might be able to fit a tech mod seamlessly in a fanatsy mod pack, to some degree of course.
